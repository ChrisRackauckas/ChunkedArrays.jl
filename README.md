ChunkedArrays is a package for increasing the performance of arrays generated
inside of loops. Some basic benchmarks show chunked arrays being almost 2x
as fast as naive approaches. One use case for this is using random numbers in
a loop. It's well known that for many reasons (including SIMD) that generating
1000 random number generators at once using `rand(1000)` is faster than generating
1000 random numbers in separate calls of `rand()`. ChunkedArrays allows you to
generate your arrays in larger amounts, but provides a convenient wrapper to hide the
details. Also included is the ability to generate the next buffer in parallel,
which allows you to utilize your array chunk and have it replaced with a new
chunk generated by a different process, maximizing efficiency.

# Installation

To install the package, simply use

```julia
Pkg.add("ChunkedArrays")
using ChunkedArrays
```

# Using the Package

You can define a ChunkedArray in one of the three forms:

```julia
ChunkedArray(chunkfunc::Function,bufferSize::Int=BUFFER_SIZE_DEFAULT,T::Type=Float64,parallel=PARALLEL_DEFAULT)
ChunkedArray(chunkfunc::Function,outputSize::NTuple,bufferSize::Int=BUFFER_SIZE_DEFAULT,T::Type=Float64;parallel=PARALLEL_DEFAULT)
ChunkedArray(chunkfunc,randPrototype::AbstractArray,bufferSize=BUFFER_SIZE_DEFAULT,parallel=PARALLEL_DEFAULT)
```

Then, to generate the next value in the array, you use the `next` function like:

```julia
next(chunked)
```

# Examples

Let's say for example we wished to generate a bunch of standard normal random
numbers in a loop. The naive way to do this is via

```julia
j=0.0
for i = 1:loopSize
  j += randn()
end
```

To use a ChunkedArray which outputs standard normal random numbers, we would use
the definition the following:

```julia
chunkRand = ChunkedArray(randn)
j=0.0
for i = 1:loopSize
  j += next(chunkRand)
end
```

This uses the constructor `ChunkedArray(chunkfunc::Function,bufferSize::Int=BUFFER_SIZE_DEFAULT,T::Type=Float64,parallel=PARALLEL_DEFAULT)`
which has a buffer size of 1000 and uses parallel generation. Note that you
do not need to be running multiple processes for parallel generation to work
(and it will still speed up in most cases due to magic). If we instead wished
to generate `randn(4,2)` each time in the loop, we can specify the dimensions:

```julia
chunkRand = ChunkedArray(randn,(4,2))
j=[0 0
   0 0
   0 0
   0 0]
for i = 1:loopSize
  j += next(chunkRand)
end
```

or simply give it a prototype:

```julia
j=[0 0
   0 0
   0 0
   0 0]
chunkRand = ChunkedArray(randn,j)
for i = 1:loopSize
  j += next(chunkRand)
end
```

and it will generate standard normals of `similar(j)`.
